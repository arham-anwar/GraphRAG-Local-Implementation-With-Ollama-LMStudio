It rose, seemingly endlessly, and came to rest across Voldemort\u2019s shoulders: its neck the thickness of a man\u2019s thigh; its eyes, with their vertical slits for pupils, unblinking. Voldemort stroked the creature absently with long thin fingers, still looking at Lucius Malfoy.\n\u201cWhy do the Malfoys look so unhappy with their lot?

Yaxley squared his shoulders.\n\u201cMy Lord, I have good news on that score. I have \u2014 with difficulty, and after great effort \u2014 suceeded in placing an Imperius Curse upon Pius Thicknesse.\u201d\nMany of those sitting around Yaxley looked impressed; his neighbor, Dolohov, a man with a long, twisted face, clapped him on the back.\n\u201cIt is a start,\u201d said Voldemort. \u201cBut Thicknesse is only one man. Scrimgeour must be surrounded by our people before I act. One failed attempt on the Minister\u2019s life will set me back a long way.\u201d\n\u201cYes \u2014 my Lord, that is true \u2014 but you know, as Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, Thicknesse has regular contact not only with the Minister himself, but also with the Heads of all the other Ministry departments.

One failed attempt on the Minister\u2019s life will set me back a long way.\u201d\n\u201cYes \u2014 my Lord, that is true \u2014 but you know, as Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, Thicknesse has regular contact not only with the Minister himself, but also with the Heads of all the other Ministry departments. It will, I think, be easy now that we have such a high-ranking official under our control, to subjugate the others, and then they can all work together to bring Scrimgeour down.\u201d\n\u201cAs long as our friend Thicknesse is not discovered before he has converted the rest,\u201d said Voldemort. \u201cAt any rate, it remains unlikely that the Ministry will be mine before next Saturday. If we cannot touch the boy at his destination, then it must be done while he travels.\u201d\n\u201cWe are at an advantage there, my Lord,\u201d said Yaxley, who seemed determined to receive some portion of approval. \u201cWe now have several people planted within the Department of Magical Transport. If Potter Apparates or uses the Floo Network, we shall know immediately.\u201d\n\u201cHe will not do either,\u201d said Snape. \u201cThe Order is eschewing any form of transport that is controlled or regulated by the Ministry; they mistrust everything to do with the place.\u201d\n\u201cAll the better,\u201d said Voldemort. \u201cHe will have to move in the open.

For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

Yaxley squared his shoulders.\n\u201cMy Lord, I have good news on that score. I have \u2014 with difficulty, and after great effort \u2014 suceeded in placing an Imperius Curse upon Pius Thicknesse.\u201d\nMany of those sitting around Yaxley looked impressed; his neighbor, Dolohov, a man with a long, twisted face, clapped him on the back.\n\u201cIt is a start,\u201d said Voldemort. \u201cBut Thicknesse is only one man. Scrimgeour must be surrounded by our people before I act. One failed attempt on the Minister\u2019s life will set me back a long way.\u201d\n\u201cYes \u2014 my Lord, that is true \u2014 but you know, as Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, Thicknesse has regular contact not only with the Minister himself, but also with the Heads of all the other Ministry departments.

It was this competitive undercurrent that kept him alert, the sense that his and Jordan's shared commitment to discovery was an unspoken rebellion against Cruz's narrowing vision of control and order.\n\nThen Taylor did something unexpected. They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. \u201cIf this tech can be understood...\" Taylor said, their voice quieter, \"It could change the game for us.

Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.
